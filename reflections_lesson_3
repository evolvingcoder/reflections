When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

WHen there is more than one contributor.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

in order to stay in control regarding the changes I want to see.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


A fork is a copy of a repository within github. A clone is a copy of a github repository or a local repository to a location on a local machine. A branch is a copy of the files of a repository within the same repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

one can easily discern the changes made since the last push or pull
