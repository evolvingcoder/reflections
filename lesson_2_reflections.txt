What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1) an invisible file with the name .git is created containing metadata about the directory. 

2) to enable tracking changes to the files contained in the directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1) number of files in staging area <= number of files in working directory/repository; staging area is intermediate, temporary area, wd/rep is final area
2) separating changes to different files into different commits


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add files separately to the staging area, so you have only one changed file per commit

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
