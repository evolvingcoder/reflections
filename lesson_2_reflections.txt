What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1) an invisible file with the name .git is created containing metadata about the directory. 

2) to enable tracking changes to the files contained in the directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1) number of files in staging area <= number of files in working directory/repository; staging area is intermediate, temporary area, wd/rep is final area
2) separating changes to different files into different commits
